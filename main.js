- twoSmallest
    -- Write a function called twoSmallest that takes in a single array of numbers as a parameter and returns the smallest two numbers in the following array format where the smallest number always comes before the 2nd smallest number (ie, the bigger number should come second):
    -- [smallestNumber, secondSmallestNumber]
    -- If the array is shorter than length 2, return undefined to the user
    -- You can assume that every number in the array will be unique
